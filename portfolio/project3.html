              <p>In my Foundations of Game Design Class, we were tasked to make a game based on the concepts and theories we have learned in class to explore and experience the full process of making a game from start to finish. The team wanted to focus on making the game as fully functional as possible based on the limited time we have.</p>

              <p>I-Land is a four-player 2D top-down sumo arena styled game. The main objective is to knock the other players off the map. The last survivor wins. The game consists of 3 different terrains/levels (beach, ice, and fire).</p>

                <h2> Design Process </h2>
                <p>Before the building process, I was in charge of designing the environment and maps before sending it to the artist to draw the final version. I began the process by sketching on paper to think of ways that would keep the map asymmetrical and interesting but also allow equal advantage for all four players. In addition, I brought those ideas into digital format and drew different versions of the map layout. After discussing with the team, we brought those layouts into the final version where the artist does the full drawing with some refinement.</p>

                <h2> Building Process </h2>

                <p>After the game concepts and environment design were solidified, I began programming the game with another teammate in order to finish the entire game on time.</p>

                </div>

                <p> The final result of the game was quite successful in terms of the enjoyment and fun. The feedback during the final showcase was positive and people had a lot of fun playing with friends. If we were to have more time, the team was thinking of making the game a bit more out of the ordinary, introducing physics and aesthetics that would stay around the same premise of our current game but instead alter the mechanics such as the power-ups to give a new experience for the player. </p>
