              <p>In IAT 343, a course that introduces students to techniques for 3D computer animation, the final project asked students to create a short animation film or game. My team chose to produce an animation film as it fits the skill of all the team members. The animation film should demonstrate a clear storyline, well-established characters and environments, and all the Maya software skills we learned throughout the course.</p>

              <p>After several brainstorming sessions, we decided to build our story upon two main characters. The two characters are tank, and both are modeled after the tanks used in World War II. One of the tanks is modeled after the Sherman battle tank used by the Allies. Whereas, the other tank is modeled after the Tiger tank used by the German. From the design of both characters, we established the settings and events to our audiences.</p>

                <h2> Process Analysis </h2>
                <p>For the first few weeks, my team were well ahead of our schedule for the tank models â€“ going from sketches to simple shapes and then develop the characters in more details. However, my team came across the challenge of modeling the environments. I am the main designer and modeler for the environment, therefore, I will walk through the process of how I manage to make the entire map. At first, I wanted to create the map out of shape objects in Maya. However, it will require a lot of shapes to just build 1 terrain. After playing around with all the tools that are familiar to me, I began searching up ways that professionals use to design levels in video games or film. I came across a tool called Sculpt Geometry Tool. Sculpt Geometry Tool allows me to manually sculpt non-uniform rational basis spline (NURBS) with the stroke of a brush. NURBS are curves and surfaces generated by computer graphics. Therefore, I created a plane in Maya and used the Sculpt Geometry Tool to pull certain parts of the plane into a terrain. In addition, I also pushed some parts of the plane down to form a more interesting environment and establish the settings of warfare. I manage to pull off the overall design of the environment and the animation film. The final project resulted in an A+ and an overall grade of A for the course. As we showcased the project in the final week, audiences were able to understand the time and place of the animation film through the design of the characters and the environment.
