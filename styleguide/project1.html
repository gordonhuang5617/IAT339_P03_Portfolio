              <p>Lattimer Gallery Documentary is a final project for the School of Interactive Arts and Technology class of IAT 344. In this project, we collaborated with the Museum of Vancouver’s Haida Now art gallery exhibition that will be open in March 2018 to produce a documentary film that would help introduce a specific subject.</p>

              <p>The team was chosen to focus our documentary on Peter Lattimer, the current owner of the Lattimer Gallery. The story that Peter Lattimer mentioned were more focused on the history of the Lattimer Gallery, how it was formed and stories about his grandmother, Leona Lattimer. Therefore, we wanted to produce a documentary film that not only introduces Lattimer Gallery to the audiences but also the history behind this remarkable store that connects the First Nation artists together.</p>

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>An undergraduate student of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. When I first started this program, I thought design was all about making things look “pretty”. However, as I proceed further into the program, I learned that design serves a purpose and tells a story. As a fourth-year undergraduate, my interests have shifted towards computer graphics. I have passions in computer-generated graphics such as 3-Dimensional modeling and animations. Through 3-D modeling I gain the ability to tell a story not from direct narrations but from the appearance of the characters and environments, allowing the users to unfold the story by themselves.</p>

                <h2> Process Analysis </h2>
                <p>Our team consists of three people each specializes in different categories of skills. My main role before the filming was producing contents, storyboarding, and sketching. In addition, I controlled two cameras during the interviews of our subject. During the editing process, my role is sound design while my teammates focus on the editing of the footages.</p>

                <p>During the interview, we used the Lavalier Microphones to capture the dialogue between the subject and the interviewer. However, after the interview is done, the sound quality was not as great as it should be. It was too distorted and there were some fabric noises as our subject was moving a lot. In order to fix the sound, sound editing was first done in Audacity to normalize and reduce the noise. In addition, the sound is edited in Adobe Premiere Pro to equalized the sound at -12 to -6 db.</p>

                <p>The main challenge that my team faced was the limited amount of time in preparation for the interview film. This was because Peter Lattimer was not the subject that the Museum of Vancouver assigned to us at first. However, due to some difficulties in scheduling and time with the previous artist, we were told that our focus has been changed and that we are filming Peter Lattimer a few days later. However, throughout the process, I learned the ability to handle problems and situations that do not go as plan. Although it was very stressful through the process, I was satisfied with the outcome of the overall project.</p>
