      <h2> Who Am I? </h2>
      <p>An undergraduate student of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University. When I first started this program, I thought design was all about making things look “pretty”. However, as I proceed further into the program, I learned that design serves a purpose and tells a story. As a fourth-year undergraduate, my interests have shifted towards computer graphics. I have passions in computer-generated graphics such as 3-Dimensional modeling and animations. Through 3-D modeling I gain the ability to tell a story not from direct narrations but from the appearance of the characters and environments, allowing the users to unfold the story by themselves.</p>
